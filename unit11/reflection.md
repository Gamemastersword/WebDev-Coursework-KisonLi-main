<h1>Unit 11 reflection</h1>
After all courses, I have gained a strong ability in building and designing websites. I started by learning the basic function of the website and also the design. Then, I practiced writing HTML to several web pages and used CSS to style them. Learning JavaScript helped me make websites more interactive. Accessibility is always told to be noticed by the course, and I learned how to make websites more inclusive for all users. Now, I feel confident in using my skills to create functional websites. I would like to build more projects, create my own website. This course has motivated me to continue learning and improving.
