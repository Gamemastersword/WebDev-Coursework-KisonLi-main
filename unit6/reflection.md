<h1>Unit 6 reflection</h1>
lesson1: By designing Kai’s webpage, I learned how to present someone’s personality and goals clearly through layout and style. It helped me improve my design skills and better understand how to communicate information effectively online.
lesson2: Creating this web page for Kai helped me better understand how to design with both style and accessibility in mind. I learned how to use absolute links, style them with CSS, and make my page more visually appealing while keeping it easy to read. Adding tooltips, images, and a consistent layout made the site more user-friendly. Getting feedback from others helped me see what parts of my design worked and what could be improved. This process showed me the importance of testing and improving based on user experience.
lesson3: After learning how to polish my web page, I realized how much small details can improve the user experience. I also used the "span" tag to highlight important text without breaking the flow. These elements may seem small, but they work together to make the site cleaner, clearer, and more engaging. 
lesson4: From getting feedback on Kai’s webpage, I learned how important it is to ask clear, specific questions to understand what the client really wants. I realized that design is not just about what looks good to me, but about what fits the client’s vision and goals.
