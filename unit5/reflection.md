<h1>Unit 5 reflection</h1>
In this unit, I learned the fundamental role of CSS in web development. Before, I thought HTML alone was enough to build a webpage, but now I understand that CSS is essential for controlling the look and feel of a site. It separates content from design, making websites easier to manage and more visually appealing. I explored basic CSS properties such as color, font-family, font-size, and background-color. Experimenting with different styles helped me see how even small changes can significantly affect a webpage’s appearance. I also discovered the three main ways to apply CSS: inline styles for quick, one-time edits; internal stylesheets using style tags for single-page projects; and external stylesheets, which are ideal for maintaining consistency across multiple pages. This unit changed how I see web design—it's not just about structure, but also about creating a polished and engaging user experience.
