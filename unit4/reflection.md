<h1>Unit 4 reflection</h1>
So there are a lot of new useful knowledge in this Unit, including the first important point called attribute, which is able to add some new things before the sentences such as the type and the titles. We can use it to custom-made what we want for the next text.
And the second point is called list. Which can add number or words to note them in order.
And there is also unordered list. The difference between them is that one of them start with ol and one use ul. There are also describe list and nested list that is useful too.
And then it is the image which is also interesting. I learnt how to design the sizes and the rules that which kinds of images can be uploaded. I used all the above to improve my website to make it easy to read.
