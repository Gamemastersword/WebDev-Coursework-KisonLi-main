Lesson 1: Using div and class helped me structure and style different sections of my webpage clearly. It made my design more organized and easier to manage. I can now apply different styles to specific areas of my site, which improves readability and makes the layout more professional and user-friendly.

Lesson 2: I explored the CSS box model and practiced using all five positioning types: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. I styled elements using only .bright and .dark classes. I now understand how spacing (padding, margin) and positioning affect layout and how different position types interact with scrolling and surrounding elements.
Lesson 3: I practiced using the CSS display property with values like none, inline, block, inline-block, flex, and grid. Each value affects layout differently, helping structure content. Using only .bright and .dark classes, I applied consistent styling. This exercise helped me understand how display types change element behavior and alignment.
Lesson 4: Responsive design offers flexibility and fluidity across all devices, making it efficient and user-friendly. Adaptive design provides better control for specific devices, ensuring optimized experiences. Both approaches are valuable; the choice depends on project needs and user expectations.
