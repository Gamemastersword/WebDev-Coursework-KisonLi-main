Creating this webpage helped reinforce my understanding of basic HTML structure and formatting tags. Writing content for Kai’s profile allowed me to think critically about how to use HTML not just for layout, but for meaning and emphasis. By using tags like strong, b, and em, I learned how to highlight important parts of a paragraph in a way that is accessible and readable, especially for screen readers.
The hr tag was also useful for dividing sections, making the content easier to follow. This project made me more confident in structuring a web page and thinking about how each element represents something deeper about a person. For example, I chose to emphasize words like “passionate,” “nature,” and “global warming” because they reflect Kai’s identity and values. That helped me connect web design to storytelling.
This project showed me that HTML is more than just code — it’s a way to communicate ideas clearly. I now understand how to create simple but meaningful layouts that reflect a client’s personality and goals. Overall, it helped solidify my foundation in HTML and taught me to think like both a coder and a designer.
