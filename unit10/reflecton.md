<h1>Unit 10 reflection</h1>
In the first lesson, I learned how to organize a website using folders like images, and external files such as style.css and script.js. I practiced linking these files using relative paths in my index.html. I also resized an image with CSS and added interactivity with JavaScript. This helped me understand how real websites are structured and how important file organization is for web development. Then, I learned how to make navigation, how to make relative website, means that there are many heml files that are connected, I think that is pretty magical and amazing. I think with this lesson, I can do better in design my own website page.
